1√. incorporate the fitting polynomical representation
2√. construct graph
3√. search path in graph and generate subgoal
4√. finish a initial main loop
5√. move to subgoal and judge if the goal is able to extend
6√. get right reference direction
7√. get right normal direction
8√. combine the DS modulation
9√. fix the wrong dynamic system modulation
10. move across the starshaped sets with multiple multiple set
11√. give a goal and reach it
12√. improve fitting result
13√. project the frontier point on the boundary
14√. fix error rotation in real environment
15. skip checking in the current starshaped
15. do experiment in gazebo

New issues

1.inapproatiate frontier points, e.g., in cornor that hard to reach;
2.wrong guide velocity vector;

Milestone:
1. put the robot at any position in a finished starshaped graph, the robot can reach the goal autonomously
2.
